## Introduction

The nRF5 SDK for Mesh is Nordic Semiconductor's implementation of the [Bluetooth Mesh](https://www.bluetooth.com/bluetooth-technology/topology-options/le-mesh). It allows applications to utilize the features provided by the Bluetooth Mesh when running on Nordic's nRF5 Series chips.

The addition of mesh networking capabilities to Bluetooth Low Energy enables extended range, increases the number of nodes and a many-to-many (m:m) communication topology. In a Bluetooth mesh network every received packet is broadcasted by relays, until the packet is received by the destination node (a so called managed flooding mesh.) A simple, but effective way of spreading information across the mesh network with no single point of failure. The mesh functionality is a significant update and enables new applications for Bluetooth in smart home, lighting, beaconing and asset tracking applications.

## Getting started

You can find detailed information about Bluetooth Mesh in [Bluetooth SIG's introduction to Bluetooth Mesh](https://blog.bluetooth.com/introducing-bluetooth-mesh-networking) and the [Bluetooth Mesh Networking Specifications](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/mesh-specifications?_ga=2.18257471.723078495.1501226603-93769939.1480503530).

The following documentation sections provide detailed information about the required software toolchains and the process of building a mesh stack.

### Installing the toolchain

To build the example applications, a toolchain based on either CMake is required. Install instructions are provided for macOS. The steps should be similar for other platforms.

#### CMake

[CMake](https://cmake.org/) is a build management system used for managing an environment that is independent of the compiler and build system used. Version 3.6 or above is required by the mesh stack.

Install CMake using `brew` on macOS:

``` sh
$ brew install cmake
```

#### GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain

The GNU Embedded Toolchain for Arm is a ready-to-use, open source suite of tools for C, C++ and Assembly programming targeting Arm Cortex-M and Cortex-R family of processors. It includes the GNU Compiler (GCC) and is available free of charge directly from Arm for embedded software development on Windows, Linux and macOS operating systems.

Download and install the `6-2017-q2-update` version. Then make sure to add the path to your toolchain to your OS PATH environment variable:

<a href="https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads"><button data-md-color-primary="marsala">Download</button></a>

``` sh
# in ~/.bash_profile, add the following script
export PATH="<path to install directory>/gcc-arm-none-eabi-6-2017-q2-update/bin:${PATH}"
```

Adding the path makes it possible to run the toolchain executables from any directory using the terminal. To verify that the path is set correctly, type the following in your terminal:

``` sh
$ arm-none-eabi-gcc --version
```

#### Ninja

[Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) is a small build system with a focus on speed. It differs from other build systems in two major respects: it is designed to have its input files generated by a higher-level build system, and it is designed to run builds as fast as possible.

Install Ninja using `brew` on macOS:

``` sh
$ brew install ninja
```

### Building the mesh stack and examples

The mesh library and example applications can be built using [CMake](https://cmake.org/) mentioned above.

Before you continue, check [Installing the toolchain](#installing-the-toolchain) for instructions on setting up the development environment for mesh.

#### Download the SDKs

The nRF5 SDK for Mesh now requires the nRF5 SDK to compile. You can download them using the following links:

* [nRF5 SDK](http://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/nordic/Products/nRF5-SDK/nRF5-SDK-zip/59011)
* [nRF5 SDK for Mesh](http://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/nordic/Products/nRF5-SDK-for-Mesh/nRF5-SDK-for-Mesh/62377)

By default, the nRF5 SDK is expected to be adjacent to the nRF5 SDK for Mesh. The directory structure should look like this:

``` sh
.
├── nrf5_SDK_for_Mesh_v2.0.1_src/
└── nRF5_SDK_15.0.0_a53641a/
```

#### Adding support for nRF52840-MDK

To add support for nRF52840-MDK, you must create a support file with the name `custom_board.h`. This file must be located in a directory in the `nRF5_SDK_15.0.0_a53641a/components/boards/` path. 

The easiest way to create the `custom_board.h` file is to start with an existing platform definition file (for example `pca10056.h`) and adapt it to:

``` c
#ifndef CUSTOM_BOARD_H
#define CUSTOM_BOARD_H

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif

#include "nrf_gpio.h"

// LEDs definitions for nRF52840-MDK
#define LEDS_NUMBER    3

#define LED_1          NRF_GPIO_PIN_MAP(0,22)
#define LED_2          NRF_GPIO_PIN_MAP(0,23)
#define LED_3          NRF_GPIO_PIN_MAP(0,24)
#define LED_START      LED_1
#define LED_STOP       LED_3

#define LEDS_ACTIVE_STATE 0

#define LEDS_LIST { LED_1, LED_2, LED_3 }

#define LEDS_INV_MASK  LEDS_MASK

#define BSP_LED_0      22
#define BSP_LED_1      23
#define BSP_LED_2      24
#define BSP_LED_3      25   // not on the board

#define BUTTONS_NUMBER 1

#define BUTTON_1       NRF_GPIO_PIN_MAP(1,0)
#define BUTTON_PULL    NRF_GPIO_PIN_PULLUP

#define BUTTONS_ACTIVE_STATE 0

#define BUTTONS_LIST { BUTTON_1 }

#define BSP_BUTTON_0   BUTTON_1


#define RX_PIN_NUMBER  19
#define TX_PIN_NUMBER  20
#define CTS_PIN_NUMBER 7  // not used
#define RTS_PIN_NUMBER 5  // not used
#define HWFC           false

#define BSP_QSPI_SCK_PIN   NRF_GPIO_PIN_MAP(1,3)
#define BSP_QSPI_CSN_PIN   NRF_GPIO_PIN_MAP(1,6)
#define BSP_QSPI_IO0_PIN   NRF_GPIO_PIN_MAP(1,5)
#define BSP_QSPI_IO1_PIN   NRF_GPIO_PIN_MAP(1,4)
#define BSP_QSPI_IO2_PIN   NRF_GPIO_PIN_MAP(1,2)
#define BSP_QSPI_IO3_PIN   NRF_GPIO_PIN_MAP(1,1)


#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif

#endif // CUSTOM_BOARD_H
```

Then create a CMake file with the name `nrf52840_mdk.cmake`. This file must be located in `nrf5_SDK_for_Mesh_v2.0.1_src/CMake/board/`.

``` sh
# nrf52840_mdk.cmake
set(nrf52840_mdk_DEFINES
    -DBOARD_CUSTOM
    -DCONFIG_GPIO_AS_PINRESET)

set(nrf52840_mdk_INCLUDE_DIRS
    "${SDK_ROOT}/components/boards")
```

Specify the nRF52840-MDK board for the `nrf52840_xxAA` platform by adapting the `nrf5_SDK_for_Mesh_v2.0.1_src/CMake/Board.cmake` file to:

``` sh
...

elseif (PLATFORM STREQUAL "nrf52840_xxAA")
    set(BOARD "pca10056" CACHE STRING "Board to build examples for.")
    set_property(CACHE BOARD PROPERTY STRINGS "pca10056" "nrf52840_mdk")
```

#### Building with CMake

Now you can try to build the mesh stack. Good practice is to create a build folder in the root directory for the mesh stack repository, where all artifacts generated by the Ninja build system are stored, such as:

``` sh
nrf5_SDK_for_Mesh_v2.0.1_src $ mkdir build
nrf5_SDK_for_Mesh_v2.0.1_src $ cd build
```

Before you can build with Ninja, you must generate the correct build files with CMake.

You can specify the required `TOOLCHAIN`, `PLATFORM` and `BOARD` name to CMAKE. The build system will ensure a valid `SOFTDEVICE` for the given platform.

``` sh
build $ cmake -G Ninja -DTOOLCHAIN=gccarmemb -DPLATFORM=nrf52840_xxAA -DBOARD=nrf52840_mdk ..
```

After the Ninja build files are generated, running `ninja` will build all the targets (examples and libraries)

``` sh
build $ ninja
```

### Running the example

To run examples onto your nRF52840-MDK, first connect it to your computer with a USB cable. When your board is detected, you can program examples as described below.

#### Programming the SoftDevice

!!! note
	All examples built by the CMake-generated build system do not include the SoftDevice as part of the generated HEX files. Therefore, the SoftDevice must already be present on the device before flashing the HEX file for the example mesh application.

Download the SoftDevice which you chose to build mesh stack with. If you do not know the SoftDevice version that was used to build the mesh stack, check the name of the example binary.

For example, if the example's binary name is `light_switch_client_nrf52840_xxAA_s140_6.0.0.hex`, the required SoftDevice binary is `s140_nrf52_6.0.0_softdevice.hex`. To program this example run:

``` sh
$ pyocd-flashtool -d debug -t nrf52 -se s140_nrf52_6.0.0_softdevice.hex
```

#### Programming the application

To program the example binary mentioned above, run:

``` sh
$ pyocd-flashtool -d debug -t nrf52 -se ./build/examples/light_switch/client/light_switch_client_nrf52840_xxAA_s140_6.0.0.hex
```

## Creating a new build 

The easiest way to make a new build target is to:

1. Copy one of the example folders, e.g., `examples/beaconing` to `examples/my_app`.

2. Add the folder to the `examples/CMakeLists.txt` with a `add_subdirectory("my_app")` command.

3. Modify the target name in the first line of `examples/my_app/CMakeLists.txt` to `set(target "my_app")`.

4. Generating build files with
	``` sh
	nrf5_SDK_for_Mesh_v2.0.1_src $ mkdir build
	nrf5_SDK_for_Mesh_v2.0.1_src $ cd build
	build $ cmake -G Ninja -DTOOLCHAIN=gccarmemb -DPLATFORM=nrf52840_xxAA -DBOARD=nrf52840_mdk ..
	```

5. Build your new target with
	``` sh
	build $ ninja my_app
	```

## More examples

Over time, more example applications will be added to the repository. You can star or watch the [nrf52840-mdk](https://github.com/makerdiary/nrf52840-mdk) repository to stay up to date.
